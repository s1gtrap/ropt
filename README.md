# ROPT

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bheart/ropt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bheart/ropt)

The simpler than dirt, 30-odd LOC, hardly-anything-compliant, command-line 
interface parsing utility. It reads hyphens in arrays of strings and reports
back.

## Usage

Stick it in your project however you like. It comes preconfigured for use with
gyp, so if that's your thing you're in luck. It has two functions, `ropt_has`
and `ropt_get`. Reading `ropt.h` should clarify what these do if not immediately
obvious.

## Building & Installation

I planted a gyp file. The rest is up to you.

## Licence

See `LICENCE`.
